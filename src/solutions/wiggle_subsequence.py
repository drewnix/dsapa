Wiggle Subsequence - Leetcode 376

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences
    (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
